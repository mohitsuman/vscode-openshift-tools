## 0.1.0 (September 19, 2019)
This release involves *Breaking Changes* !!

* Components created with previous version will no longer be identified. Therefore after extension is updated to new version(`0.1.0`) all previously deployed components won't be visible in OpenShift Application View.
* For older versions, here is the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/wiki/Migration-to-v0.1.0).

### Added
* Every component/service needs to have a context folder. The extension will prompt the user to specify the context folder with the creation of component/service.
* The selected context folder will reside in the vscode workspace.
* `Create Component` creates a local component configuration within `./.odo/config.yaml` in the context folder selected, nothing is created on the cluster at this point.
* All component configurations are saved to ./.odo/config.yaml. You can commit this file to your repository to easily recreate component with the same configuration later, or to share it with someone else.
* To deploy the component to a cluster or to apply config changes, run `PUSH` command for the component.
    * `PUSH` will create component/urls/storage on the OpenShift cluster and push your local files to it.
* `Import` actions for components which were created using old versions of the extension.
* Support for OpenShift 4.x clusters.
* Update Actions to Navigation Item
    * Add Switch Contexts - This will help users to switch contexts from kubeconfig.
    * Add Issue tracker - Users can directly file extension issues/feedback.
* Added Multiple Actions to Kubernetes resources in Kubernetes View.
    * For Build Configs - Start Build, Rebuild, Show Logs, Follow Logs
    * For Deployment Configs - Deploy, Show Logs
    * Add `Open in Console` for k8s resources in Kubernetes View.

### Changes
* The openshift labels used internally by odo to identify its components, have been updated to match https://github.com/gorkem/app-labels/blob/master/labels-annotation-for-openshift.adoc.
* Components can be in 3 stages:
    * pushed - When the components are deployed into the cluster.
    * not pushed - When are the components are in local config but NOT deployed into the cluster.
    * no context - When there is no context folder associated with the component in the workspace.
* Extension uses [odo-v1.0.0-beta5](https://github.com/openshift/odo/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta5).
* Remove Clusters view from OpenShift Views Container. Users can perform all the required action from Kubernetes extension Clusters view.
